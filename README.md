# Blender Python Scripts

A personal collection of Python scripts and add-ons for Blender.  
These tools were created to improve my own workflow, but they’re freely available for anyone to download and use.

## Features
- Custom shortcuts for faster actions
- Automated tasks for modeling, saving, and selection
- Small utilities to speed up daily work in Blender

## Installation
1. Download the `.py` file you want to use.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...** and select the downloaded `.py` file.
4. Enable the add-on in the list.
5. The new functionality will be available immediately.

If the shortcut doesn’t work:
	•	Go to Edit > Preferences > Keymap.
	•	Search for the operator name (e.g., wm.select_all_then_save_alt).
	•	Add a new key binding manually with your preferred key combination.
